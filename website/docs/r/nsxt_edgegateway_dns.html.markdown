# vcd\_nsxt\_edgegateway\_dns

Supported in provider *v3.11+* and VCD 10.4.0+ with NSX-T.

Provides a resource to manage NSX-T Edge Gateway DNS configuration.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "vcd_org_vdc" "v1" {
  org  = "datacloud"
  name = "nsxt-vdc-datacloud"
}

data "vcd_nsxt_edgegateway" "testing-in-vdc" {
  org      = "datacloud"
  owner_id = data.vcd_org_vdc.v1.id

  name = "nsxt-gw-datacloud"
}

resource "vcd_nsxt_edgegateway_dns" "testing-in-vdc" {
  org             = "datacloud"
  edge_gateway_id = data.vcd_nsxt_edgegateway.testing-in-vdc.id
  enabled         = true

  default_forwarder_zone {
    name = "testing"

    upstream_servers = [
      "1.1.1.1",
      "2.2.2.2",
    ]
  }

  conditional_forwarder_zone {
    name = "conditional_testing"

    upstream_servers = [
      "3.3.3.3",
      "4.4.4.4",
    ]

    domain_names = [
      "example.org",
      "nonexistent.org",
    ]
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `org` - (Optional) Org in which the NSX-T Edge Gateway is located, required
  if not set in the provider section.
* `edge_gateway_id` - (Required) NSX-T Edge Gateway ID
* `enabled` - (Optional) Status of the DNS forwarding service. Defaults to `true`.
* `listener_ip` - (Optional) The IP on which the DNS forwarder listens. If the Edge Gateway 
  has a dedicated external network, this can be changed.
* `snat_rule_enabled` -
* `default_forwarder_zone` - (Required) The default forwarder zone to use if 
  thereâ€™s no matching domain in the conditional forwarder zones. See [#default-forwarder-zone]
* `conditional_forwarder_zone` - (Optional) A set of conditional forwarder zones that allows to define 
  specific forwarding routes based on the domain. See [#conditional-forwarder-zone]

## Attribute Reference

* `snat_rule_enabled` - If 


## Importing

~> The current implementation of Terraform import can only import resources into the state.
It does not generate configuration. [More information.](https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/)

An existing NSX-T Edge Gateway Rate Limiting configuration can be [imported][docs-import] into this
resource via supplying path for it. An example is below:

[docs-import]: https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/

```
terraform import vcd_nsxt_edgegateway_rate_limiting.imported my-org.nsxt-vdc.nsxt-edge
```

The above would import the `nsxt-edge` Edge Gateway Rate Limiting configuration for this particular
Edge Gateway.
